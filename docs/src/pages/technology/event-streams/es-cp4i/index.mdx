title: Event Streams within Cloud Pak for Integration
description: Hands on lab to deploy Event Streams on OpenShift
---

In this tutorial you will learn how to install Event Streams on OpenShift, using a the Administration Console, or using CLI.

We propose two installation tutorials: 

* one using the OpenShift Admin console, then the Event Streams console to create Kafka topics and use a Starter Application,
to validate the installation
* one using `oc CLI` from your terminal or from Cloud Shell Terminal.

The Kafka Cluster configuration is for a development or staging environment with no persistence.

Once the installation is successful, the final pods running in the `eventstreams` project are:

 ```sh
 ```

**Updated October 07/2021 - Operator Release 2.4 - Product Release 10.4 - Kafka 2.8**

We recommend to read the following ["structuring your deployment" chapter from product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.3?topic=installation-structuring-your-deployment)
to give you more insight of the things to consider for deployment. 

In this tutorial we select to deploy Event Streams in one namespace.

## Prerequisites

* Get access to an OpenShift Cluster.
* Get `oc ` CLI from OpenShift Admin Console

### Install Other CLIs 

* Install IBM Cloud Pak CLI: Cloudctl is a command line tool to manage Container Application Software for Enterprises (CASEs). 
This CLI will allow us to manage Cloud Pak related components as well as software, like IBM Event Streams, installed through any IBM Cloud Pak. In order to install it, execute the following commands in your IBM Cloud Shell:

  * Download the IBM Cloud Pak CLI: 
```
curl -L https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak-cli/releases/latest/download/cloudctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o cloudctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
  * Untar it
```
tar -xvf cloudctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
  * Rename it as cloudctl and move to a folder within your PATH:
```
mv cloudctl-linux-amd64 cloudctl
```
  * Make sure your IBM Cloud Pak CLI is in the path: `which cloudctl`
  * Make sure your IBM Cloud Pak CLI works: `cloudctl help`

![shell2](./images/shell2-v10.png)

* Get Event Streams plugin for IBM Cloud Pak CLI: This plugin will allow us to manage IBM Event Streams. In order to install it, execute the following commands in your IBM Cloud Shell:

```
curl -L http://ibm.biz/es-cli-linux -o es-plugin
```
   * Install it: 
```
cloudctl plugin install es-plugin
```
   * Make sure it works: `cloudctl es help`

![shell3](./images/shell3-v10.png)

See also the product documentation for [prerequisites details](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/installing/prerequisites/)

### Install IBM catalog

Use the EDA Gitops project with the different operator subscriptions and IBM catalog to define
the IBM Operator catalog.

    ```sh
    # List existing catalog
    oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
    # Add IBM catalog if needed   
    oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-gitops-catalog/main/ibm-catalog/catalog_source.yaml
    ```

### Get IBM Software entitlement key and create a secret

* Obtain [IBM license entitlement key](https://github.com/IBM/cloudpak-gitops/blob/main/docs/install.md#obtain-an-entitlement-key).

* Create a OpenShift secret in the `openshift-operator` project 

    ```sh
    # Get on good project
    oc project openshift-operators
    # Verify it secret exists
    oc describe secret ibm-entitlement-key
    # Create if needed
    oc create secret docker-registry ibm-entitlement-key \
        --docker-username=cp \
        --docker-server=cp.icr.io \
        --namespace=eventstreams \
        --docker-password=your_entitlement_key 
    ```

### Plaform sizing

A lot of information is available for sizing:

* [Cloud Pak for integration system requirements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.3?topic=installation-system-requirements)
* [Foundational service specifics](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.3?topic=requirements-sizing-foundational-services)
* [Event Streams resource requirements](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/installing/prerequisites/)
* Kafka has a [sizing tool (eventsizer)](https://eventsizer.io/) that may be questionable but some people are using it.

## Install Event Streams Using OpenShift Console

* As Cluster Administrator, create a project using Home > Projects, and create button, and enter `eventstreams` as project name.

    ![](./images/create-project.png)

The goal is to create a shareable Kafka cluster. 

* As Administrator, use `Openshift console -> Operators > OperatorHub` to search for `Event Streams` operator, then install the operator by selecting
the one namespace only, the version v2.4. The Opertor monitors all namespaces.

  ![](./images/es-operator-cfg.png)

  The installation of this operator will also include pre-requisites operators like: 

  * Cloud Pak foundational services (3.11)
  * Event Streams (2.4)

* Once the Operator is ready, go to the `Installed Operator` under the `eventstreams` project

 ![](./images/es-operator-home.png)

* Create an Event Streams cluster instance using the operator user interface:

 ![](./images/create-es-instance.png)

  Enter the minimum information for a development cluster, like name, license,.. 

  ![](./images/es-top-form.png)

  Or go to the `Yaml view` and select one of the proposed Sample:
  
  ![](./images/es-yaml-view.png)
  
  The `Development` configuration should be enough to get you started. For production
  deployment [see this article](/technology/event-streams/es-cp4i/es-production/).
  
  Do not forget to set `spec.license.accept` to true.

  Before creating the instance, we recommend you read [the security summary](/technology/security/) 
  so you can relate the authentication configured by default with what application
  need to use to connect to the kafka cluster. For example the following declaration stipulates
  to use TLS authentication for internal communication, and SCRAM for external connection.

    ```yaml
        listeners:
        external:
          authentication:
            type: scram-sha-512
          type: route
        tls:
          authentication:
            type: tls
    ```

It may take some time to start all the event streams pods. The result of this cluster creation should looks like: 

with the list of pod as illustrated in first.

### Log into Event Streams

1. From the project where your IBM Event Streams instance was installed (e.g. `eventstreams`) go to `Operators --> Installed Operators`.
1. Click on the IBM Event Streams Operator and then on the `Event Streams` option listed at the top bar
1. Click on the IBM Event Streams instance you want to access to its console and scroll down until you see the `Admin UI` attribute that displays the route to this IBM Event Streams instance's console.
  ![login3](./images/login3.png)
1. Click on the route link and enter your IBM Event Streams credentials.

### Create Event Streams Topics

This section is a generic example of the steps to proceed to define a topic with Event Streams on OpenShift. The example is to define a topic named INBOUND with 1 partition and a replica set to 3.

1. Log into your IBM Event Streams instance through the UI as explained in the previous section.

1. Click on the Topics option on the navigation bar on the left. 

1. In the topics page, click on the `Create topic` blue button on the top right corner

  ![Create Topic](./images/create-topic.png)

1. Provide a name for your topic.

  ![Topic Name](./images/inbound-topic-name.png)

1. Leave Partitions at 1.

  ![Partition](./images/partitions.png)

1. Depending on how long you want messages to persist you can change this.

  ![Message Retention](./images/message-retention.png)

1. You can leave Replication Factor at the default 3.

  ![Replication](./images/replicas.png)

1. Click Create.
1. Make sure the topic has been created by navigating to the topics section on the IBM Event Streams user inteface you can find an option for in the left hand side menu bar.

## Install Event Streams Using CLIs 

* Create a project to host eventstreams cluster:

  ```shell
  oc new-project eventstreams
  ```
* Clone our eda-gitops-catalog project

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-gitops-catalog.git
  ```
* Create the `ibm-entitlement-key` secret in this project

* Install Event Streams Operator subscriptions

  ```sh
  oc apply -k cp4i-operators/event-streams/operator/overlays/v2.4/
  ```

* Install one Event Streams instance: Instances of Event Streams can be created after the Event Streams operator is installed. You can use te OpenShift console or our predefined cluster defintion:

  ```shell
  oc apply -k cp4i-operators/event-streams/operator/overlays/v2.4/
  ```


### Access to Event Streams Console using CLI

In order to log into IBM Event Streams console through the CLI, 
we are going to use the `oc` OpenShift CLI, the `clouctl` Cloud Pak CLI and the `es` Cloud Pak CLI plugin. 
We assume you are already logged into your OpenShift cluster.

1. Get your Cloud Pak Console route (you may need cluster wide admin permissions to do so as the Cloud Pak Console is usually installed in the `ibm-common-services` namespace by the cluster admins)

  ```shell
  $ oc get routes -n ibm-common-services | grep console
  cp-console                       cp-console.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net                                                  icp-management-ingress           https      reencrypt/Redirect     None
  ```

1. Log into IBM Event Streams using the Cloud Pak console route from the previous step:

  ```shell
  $ cloudctl login -a https://cp-console.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net --skip-ssl-validation

  Username> user50

  Password>
  Authenticating...
  OK

  Targeted account mycluster Account

  Enter a namespace > integration
  Targeted namespace integration

  Configuring kubectl ...
  Property "clusters.mycluster" unset.
  Property "users.mycluster-user" unset.
  Property "contexts.mycluster-context" unset.
  Cluster "mycluster" set.
  User "mycluster-user" set.
  Context "mycluster-context" created.
  Switched to context "mycluster-context".
  OK

  Configuring helm: /Users/user/.helm
  OK
  ```

1. Initialize the Event Streams CLI plugin (make sure you provide the namespace where your IBM Event Streams instance is installed on as the command will fail if you dont have cluster wide admin permissions)

  ```shell
  $ cloudctl es init -n eventstreams
                                                  
  IBM Cloud Platform Common Services endpoint:   https://cp-console.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
  Namespace:                                     integration   
  Name:                                          kafka   
  IBM Cloud Pak for Integration UI address:      https://integration-navigator-pn-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
  Event Streams API endpoint:                    https://kafka-ibm-es-admapi-external-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
  Event Streams API status:                      OK   
  Event Streams UI address:                      https://kafka-ibm-es-ui-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
  Apicurio Registry endpoint:                    https://kafka-ibm-es-ac-reg-external-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
  Event Streams bootstrap address:               kafka-kafka-bootstrap-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net:443   
  OK
  ``` 


#### CLI

1. Log into your IBM Event Streams instance using the CLI as explained in the previous section.

1. Create the topic with the desirec specification.

   ```shell
   cloudctl es topic-create --name INBOUND --partitions 1 --replication-factor 3
   ```

1. Make sure the topic has been created by listing the topics.

  ```shell
  $ cloudctl es topics
  Topic name   
  INBOUND   
  OK
  ```

## Get Kafka Bootstrap Url

In this section we are going to see where to find your IBM Event Streams and Kafka bootstrap url/address your applications will need in order to connect to IBM Event Streams to consume messages from and produce messages to.

#### UI

You can find your IBM Event Streams and Kakfa bootstrap url if you log into the IBM Event Streams user interface, as explained previously in this readme, and click on the `Connect to this cluster` option displayed on the dashboard. This will display a menu where you will see a url to the left of the `Generate SCAM credentials` button. Make sure that you are on the **External Connection**.

![Connect to this Cluster bootstrap](./images/esv10-connect-to-cluster-bootstrap.png)

#### CLI

You can find your IBM Event Streams and Kakfa bootstrap url when you init the IBM Event Streams Cloud Pak CLI plugin on the last line:

```shell
$ cloudctl es init -n integration
                                                  
IBM Cloud Platform Common Services endpoint:   https://cp-console.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
Namespace:                                     integration   
Name:                                          kafka   
IBM Cloud Pak for Integration UI address:      https://integration-navigator-pn-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
Event Streams API endpoint:                    https://kafka-ibm-es-admapi-external-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
Event Streams API status:                      OK   
Event Streams UI address:                      https://kafka-ibm-es-ui-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
Apicurio Registry endpoint:                    https://kafka-ibm-es-ac-reg-external-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net   
Event Streams bootstrap address:               kafka-kafka-bootstrap-integration.apps.eda-sandbox-delta.gse-ocp.net:443   
OK
``` 
  
## Generate SCRAM Service Credentials

For an application to connect to an Event Streams instance through the secured external listener, it needs SCRAM credentials to act as service credentials (as well as the TLS certificate we will talk about in the next section of this readme). 

#### UI

1. Log into the IBM Event Streams user interface as explained previously in this readme and click on the `Connect to this cluster` option displayed on the dashboard. This will display a menu. Make sure that you are on the **External Connection**.

  ![Connect to this Cluster](./images/esv10-connect-to-cluster.png)

1. Click on the `Generate SCRAM credentials` button.

  ![Generate SCRAM1 ](./images/esv10-generate-scram.png)

1. Introduce a name for your credentials and choose the option that better suits the needs of your applications (this will create RBAC permissions for you credentials so that a service credentials can do only what it needs to do). For this demo, select `Produce messages, consume messages and create topics and schemas` last option.

  ![Generate SCRAM 2](./images/esv10-scram-1.png)

1. Decide whether your service credentials need to have the ability to access all topics or certain topics only. For this demo, select `All Topics` and then click Next.

  ![Generate SCRAM 3](./images/esv10-scram-2.png)

1. Decide whether your service credentials need to have the ability to access all consumer groups or certain specific consumer groups only. For this demo, select `All Consumer Groups` and click Next.

  ![Generate SCRAM 4](./images/esv10-scram-3.png)

1. Decide whether your service credentials need to have the ability to access all transactional IDs or certain specific transactional IDs only. For this demo, select `All transaction IDs` and click on `Generate credentials`.

  ![Generate SCRAM 5](./images/esv10-scram-4.png)

1. **Take note** of the set of credentials displayed on screen. You will need to provide your applications with these in order to get authenticated and authorized with your IBM Event Streams instance.

  ![Generate SCRAM 6](./images/esv10-scram-5.png)

1. If you did not take note of your SCRAM credentials or you forgot these, the above will create a `KafkaUser` object in OpenShift that is interpreted by the IBM Event Streams Operator. You can see this `KafkaUser` if you go to the OpenShift console, click on `Operators --> Installed Operators` on the right hand side menu, then click on the `IBM Event Streams` operator and finally click on `Kafka Users` at the top bar menu.

  ![Retrieve SCRAM 1](./images/esv10-retrieve-scram-1.png)

1. If you click on your `Kafka User`, you will see what is the Kubernetes secret behind holding your SCRAM credentials details.

  ![Retrieve SCRAM 2](./images/esv10-retrieve-scram-2.png)

1. Click on that secret and you will be able to see again your `SCRAM password` (your `SCRAM username` is the same name as the `Kafka User` created or the secret holding your `SCRAM password`) 

  ![Retrieve SCRAM 3](./images/esv10-retrieve-scram-3.png)


#### CLI

1. Log into your IBM Event Streams instance through the CLI as already explained before in this readme.

1. Create your SCRAM service credentials with the following command (adjust the topics, consumer groups, transaction IDs, etc permissions your SCRAM service credentials should have in order to satisfy your application requirements):

  ```shell
  $ cloudctl es kafka-user-create --name test-credentials-cli --consumer --producer --schema-topic-create --all-topics --all-groups --all-txnids --auth-type scram-sha-512
  
  KafkaUser name         Authentication   Authorization   Username                                                Secret   
  test-credentials-cli   scram-sha-512    simple          EntityOperator has not created corresponding username   EntityOperator has not created corresponding secret   
  
  Resource type     Name        Pattern type   Host   Operation   
  topic             *           literal        *      Read   
  topic             __schema_   prefix         *      Read   
  topic             *           literal        *      Write   
  topic             *           literal        *      Create   
  topic             __schema_   prefix         *      Alter   
  group             *           literal        *      Read   
  transactionalId   *           literal        *      Write   
  
  Created KafkaUser test-credentials-cli.
  OK
  ```

1. List the `KafkaUser` objects to make sure yours has been created:

  ```shell
  $ cloudctl es kafka-users
  KafkaUser name                    Authentication   Authorization   
  test-credentials                  scram-sha-512    simple   
  test-credentials-cli              scram-sha-512    simple   
  OK
  ```

1. To retrieve your credentials execute the following command:

  ```shell
  $ cloudctl es kafka-user test-credentials-cli 
  KafkaUser name         Authentication   Authorization   Username               Secret   
  test-credentials-cli   scram-sha-512    simple          test-credentials-cli   test-credentials-cli   

  Resource type     Name        Pattern type   Host   Operation   
  topic             *           literal        *      Read   
  topic             __schema_   prefix         *      Read   
  topic             *           literal        *      Write   
  topic             *           literal        *      Create   
  topic             __schema_   prefix         *      Alter   
  group             *           literal        *      Read   
  transactionalId   *           literal        *      Write   
  OK
  ```

1. Above you can see your `SCRAM username` under `Username` and the secret holding your `SCRAM password` under `Secret`. In order to retrieve the password, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  $ oc get secret test-credentials-cli -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode 
  
  *******
  ```

## Get Event Streams TLS Certificates

In this section we are going to see how to download the TLS certificats to securely connect to our IBM Event Streams instance.

#### UI

1. Log into the IBM Event Streams console user interface as explained before in this readme.

1. Click on the `Connect to this cluster` option displayed on the dashboard. This will display a menu where you will see a `Certificates` section:

  ![PKCS12 Truststore](./images/esv10-pkcs12.png)

1. Depending on what language your application is written into, you will need a `PKCS12 certificate` or a `PEM certificate`. Click on `Download certificate` for any of the options you need. If it is the `PKCS12 certificate` bear in mind it comes with a password for the truststore. You don't need to write this down as it will display any time you click on `Download certificate` button.

#### CLI

1. Log into IBM Event Streams through the CLI as already explained before in this readme.

1. To retrieve the `PKCS12 certificate` execute the following command:

  ```shell
  $ cloudctl es certificates --format p12
  Trustore password is ********
  Certificate successfully written to /Users/testUser/Downloads/es-cert.p12.
  OK
  ```

1. To retrieve the `PEM certificate` execute the following command:

  ```shell
  $ cloudctl es certificates --format pem
  Certificate successfully written to /Users/testUser/Downloads/es-cert.pem.
  OK
  ```

**NEXT:** For more information about how to connect to your cluste, read the [IBM Event Streams product documentation](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/getting-started/connecting/)
