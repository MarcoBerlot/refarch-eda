We have documented in [this note](../../kafka-monitoring/) the major tools for monitoring a Kafka cluster. like prometheus and Grafana.

The following [Sysdig getting started tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-getting-started#getting-started) should be done to understand the different features of this product.

* Enable Event Streams to be monitored and select the monitoring service.
