The adoption of event-driven architecture is based four main technical drivers:

![](./images/4-usecases.png)

* Communication layer:  

  * Adopt messaging and asynchronous communication between applications and 
microservices for loosely coupled services (See [this note](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-integration/service-mesh/readme/#asynchronous-loosely-coupled-solution-using-events) where we present a way to support a service mesh solution using asynchronous event).
The data are pushed as immutables record, or commands are sent with exactly once delivery. Reducing pull data approach. 
  * Pub/sub messaging for cloud native applications to improve communication inter microservices.
  * Support Always-on services with asynchronous data replication.
  * Expose data to any application to consume.

* Reactive systems: to support reactive, responsive applications for addressing
resiliency, scaling so adopting message buses.

* Data Agility:

  * Centralize online data pipeline to decouple applications and microservices.
  * Monitor distributed applications to produce centralized feed of operational data.
  * Logs collector from multiple services.
  * Implement [event sourcing pattern](/patterns/event-sourcing/) out of the box, using configuration to keep message for a long time period. Data are replicated between brokers within the cluster and cross availability zones if needed.

* Near real-time analytics insights:
  * Aggregation of event coming from multiple producers.
  * Look at event sequencing patterns
  * Compute next best action from event streams
