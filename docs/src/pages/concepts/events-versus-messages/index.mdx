## MQ Versus Kafka

Consider queue system. like IBM MQ, for:

* Exactly once delivery, and to participate into two phase commit transaction
* Asynchronous request / reply communication: the semantic of the communication is for one component to ask a second command to do something on its data. This is a command pattern with delay on the response.
* Recall messages in queue are kept until consumer(s) got them.

Consider Kafka as pub/sub and persistence system for:

* Publish events as immutable facts of what happened in an application
* Get continuous visibility of the data Streams
* Keep data once consumed, for future consumers, for replay-ability
* Scale horizontally the message consumption

### Direct product feature comparison

| Kafka | IBM MQ | 
| --- | --- |
| Kafka is a pub/sub engine with streams and connectors | MQ is a queue, pub/sub engine with file transfer, MQTT, AMQP and other capabilities |
| All topics are persistent  | Queues and topics can be persistent or non persistent |
| All subscribers are durable | Subscribers can be durable or non durable |
| Adding brokers to requires little work (changing a configuration file)| Adding QMGRs requires some work (Add the QMGRs to the cluster, add cluster channels.  Queues and Topics need to be added to the cluster.) |
| Topics can be spread across brokers (partitions) with a command | Queues and topics can be spread across a cluster by adding them to clustered QMGRs |
| Producers and Consumers are aware of changes made to the cluster | All MQ clients require a CCDT file to know of changes if not using a gateway QMGR |
| Can have n number of replication partitions | Can have 2 replicas (RDQM) of a QMGR, Multi Instance QMGRs |
| Simple load balancing | Load balancing can be simple or more complex using weights and affinity |
| Can reread messages | Cannot reread messages that have been already processed | 
| All clients connect using a single connection method | MQ has Channels which allow different clients to connect, each having the ability to have different security requirements | 
| Data Streams processing built in, using Kafka topic for efficiency| Stream processing is not built in, but using third party libraries, like MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, ReactiveX, etc. |
| Has connection security, authentication security, and ACLs (read/write to Topic) | Has connection security, channel security, authentication security, message security/encryption, ACLs for each Object, third party plugins (Channel Exits) |
| Built on Java, so can run on any platform that support Java 8+ | Latest native on AIX, IBM i, Linux systems, Solaris, Windows, z/OS, run as Container | 
| Monitoring by using statistics provided by Kafka CLI, open source tools, Prometheus | Monitoring using PCF API, MQ Explorer, MQ CLI (runmqsc), Third Party Tools (Tivoli, CA APM, Help Systems, Open Source, etc) |


## Events and Messages

There is a long history of *messaging* in IT systems.  You can easily see an event driven solution and events in the context of messaging systems and messages. However, there are different characteristics that are worth considering:

* **Messaging:** Messages transport a payload and messages are persisted until consumed. Message consumers are typically directly targeted and related to the producer who cares that the message has been delivered and processed.
* **Events:** Events are persisted as a replayable stream history. Event consumers are not tied to the producer. An event is a record of something that has happened and so can't be changed. (You can't change history.)

## Messaging versus event streaming

We recommend reading [this article](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/2018/05/18/comparing-messaging-event-streaming-use-cases/) and [this one](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/2019/02/05/comparing-messaging-pub-sub-and-event-streams/), to get insight on messaging (focusing on operations / actions to be performed by a system or service) versus events (focusing on the state / facts of a system with no knowledge of the downstream processing).

To summarize messaging (like MQ) are to support:

* **Transient Data:** data is only stored until a consumer has processed the message, or it expires.
* **Request / reply** most of the time.
* **Targeted reliable delivery:** targeted to the entity that will process the request or receive the response. Reliable with transaction support.
* **Highly Coupled** producers and consumers

For events:

* **Stream History:** consumers are interested in historic events, not just the most recent.
* **Scalable Consumption:** A single event is consumed by many consumers with limited impact as the number of consumers grow.
* **Immutable Data**
* **Loosely coupled / decoupled** producers and consumers
