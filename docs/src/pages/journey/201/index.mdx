## More Kafka

We have already covered the Kafka architecture in [this section](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/technology/kafka-overview/#kafka-components).
When we deploy Event Streams on Kubernetes, it uses Operator, and it is in fact a wrapper on top of [Strimzi](http://strimzi.io),
the open source kafka operator.

### Strimzi

[Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/) uses the Cluster Operator to deploy and manage Kafka (including Zookeeper) and Kafka Connect clusters. 
When the Strimzi Cluster Operator is up and runnning, it starts to watch for certain OpenShift or Kubernetes resources containing the 
desired Kafka and/or Kafka Connect cluster configuration. 

![Strimzi](./images/strimzi.png)

It supports the following capabilities:

* Deploy Kafka OOS on any OpenShift or k8s platform
* Support TLS and SCRAM-SHA authentication, and automated certificate management
* Define operators for cluster, users and topics
* All resources are defined in yaml file so easily integrated into GitOps

The Cluster Operator is a pod used to deploys and manages Apache Kafka clusters, Kafka 
Connect, Kafka MirrorMaker (1 and 2), Kafka Bridge, Kafka Exporter, and the Entity Operator.
When deployed the following commands goes to the Cluster operator:

```shell
# Get the current cluster list
oc get kafka
# get the list of topic
oc get kafkatopics
```

#### Installation on OpenShift

The Strimzi operators deployment is done in two phases:

* Deploy the main operator via Subscription
* Deploy one to many instances of the Strimzi CRDs: cluster, users, topics...

For that we have define subscription and configuration in [this eda-gitops-catalog repo](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-gitops-catalog). 
So below are the operations to perform:

```shell
 # clone 
 git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-gitops-catalog.git
 # Define subscription
 oc apply -k kafka-strimzi/operator/overlays/stable/
 # The subscription creates an operator pod under the openshift-operators project
 oc get pods -n openshift-operators
 # Create a project e.g. strimzi
 oc new-project strimzi
 # deploy a simple kafka cluster with 3 brokers
 oc apply -k  kafka-strimzi/instance/
 # Verify installation
 oc get pods
 # should get kafka, zookeeper and the entity operator running.
```

The [Strimzi documentation](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/using.html) is very good to present a lot of configuration and tuning practices.

#### Application

All applications written with Kafka API will work the same way with Strimzi and Event Streams. So developer
can use Strimzi images for their local development.

## Production deployment - High Availability

Kafka clustering brings availability for message replication and failover, see details in this [high availability section.](/technology/kafka-overview/advance/#high-availability)
This chapter also presents replicas, in-synch replicas concepts and failure scenarios.
