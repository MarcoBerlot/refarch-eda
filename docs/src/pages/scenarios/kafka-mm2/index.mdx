## Pre-requisites

The following steps need to be done to get the configurations for the different scenario and the docker-compose file to start a local cluster. 

1. Clone the lab repository

 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda-data-consistency
 ```

1. Get [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) desktop and docker compose on your local computer.  and docker compose to run the solution locally.

 If for security reason you are not able to install docker on your local workstation, but you have access to a kubernetes cluster, like OpenShift, see the [next section](#running-docker-in-kubernetes-pod).

 In this project main folder there is a [docker compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda-data-consistency/master/docker-compose.yml) to start a local three brokers cluster with two Zookeeper nodes.

1. In one Terminal window, start the local cluster using `docker-compose up &` command. The data are persisted on the local disk within this folder.

Your environment is up and running.

## Kafka Mirror Maker 2 Labs

These hands-on labs walk users through building and testing Kafka Mirror Maker 2 based replication.
