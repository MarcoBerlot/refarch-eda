description: Different fit to purpose evaluation and criteria for technologies involved in EDA

In this note we want to list some of the criterias to consider and assess during an architecture establishment work. This is not fully exhaustive, but give good foundation for analysis and study.

## MQ Versus Kafka

Consider queue system for:

* Exactly once, and to participate into two phase commit transaction
* Asynchronous request / reply communication
* To implement operations/ commands to target a system to do something

Consider Kafka as pub/sub and persistence system for:

* Publish events as immutable facts of what happen in an application
* Get continuous visibility of the data Streams
* Keep data once consumed, for future consumers, for replayability
* Scale horizontally the message consumption

## Kafka Streams vs Apache Flink

[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org) (2016) is a framework and **distributed processing** engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. It is considered to be superior to spark and hadoop. It supports batch and graph processing. 

Here is simple diagram of Flink architecture.

The run time can run on any common resource manager like Hadoop Yarn, Mesos, or kubernetes. It can run on its own with two majors cluster types: Job manager and task manager. Two types of processing: data set or data stream. For development purpose we can use the docker images to deploy a **Session** or **Job cluster** in a containerized environment.
