## Overview

- In this lab scenario we're going to use [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) to develop the core application with Kafka streams api and microprofile reactive messaging.
- We will be testing using [Apache Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) TestDriver to mimic a Topology, a Stream and Table.

The requirements to address are:

- consume item sold from items topic, item has unique key. Item event has store information
- compute for each item its current stock cross store
- compute the store stock for each item
- generate inventory event for store - item - stock
- expose APIs to get stock for a store or for an item

## Scenario Prerequisites

**Java**
- For the purposes of this lab we suggest Java 11+

**Maven**
- Maven will be needed for bootstrapping our application from the command-line and running
our application.

**An IDE of your choice**
- Ideally an IDE that supports Quarkus (such as Visual Studio Code)

**OpenShift Container Platform**
- v4.4.x

**IBM Cloud Pak for Integration**
- CP4I2020.2

**IBM Event Streams**
- The section on use with Event Streams on CP4I assumes Event Streams v10. If using a previous version such as ESv2019.4.2, there are some differences to how you would configure `application.properties` to establish a connection.

**Code Source**: clone the following git repository: `git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda-item-inventory`


## Develop the application

### Setting up the Quarkus Application

- We will bootstrap the Quarkus application with the following Maven command

```shell
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.7.2.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId={com.ibm} \
    -DprojectArtifactId={quarkus-kstreams-lab} \
    -Dextensions="kafka,kafka-streams,resteasy-jsonb,smallrye-health,smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka,quarkus-smallrye-openapi,quarkus-kafka-streams,openshift"
```

You can replace the fields within {} as you like.
- recall that is if you want to add an extension do something like: `./mvnw Quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="kafka"`
- Since we will be using the Kafka Streams testing functionality we will need to edit the `pom.xml` to add
the dependency to our project. Open `pom.xml` and add the following.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>kafka-streams-test-utils</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
### Start the dev mode 

```shell
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

## Define the domain entities

Under the `src/main/java/../domain` folder add the two classes representing the business entities we are using:

```Java
public class Item {
    public static String RESTOCK = "RESTOCK";
    public static String SALE = "SALE";
    public String storeName;
    public String sku;
    public int quantity;
    public String type;
    public Double price;
    public String timestamp;

    public Item(){}
}
```

This item will also being used for event structure on `items` topic. The type attribute is to specify if this is a sale event or a restock event.

The inventory per store includes a map of item.sku and quantity.

```Java
public class Inventory {
    public String storeName;
    public HashMap<String,Long> stock = new HashMap<String,Long>();
    public Inventory(){}
}
```
