[IBM MQ](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.pro.doc/q001020_.htm) is the enterprise solution to exchange message over queues. 
As it supports loosely coupling communication between applications, via asynchronous protocol, it is part of the event driven architecture product portfolio and makes senses to continue to include it as part of modern cloud native solutions. 

This note is to summarize, for architect, the technology as it fits into EDA and gives pointers to important documentations, articles, and code repositories for using MQ.

We already addressed the [difference between event and messaging](../../concepts/events-versus-messages) systems, and we can affirm that real production plaform needs to include both. This site includes a lot on Kafka as the backbone to support EDA, but MQ delivers a very important missing element for Kafka, is the transactional support to write message to queue for ensuring message delivery. 

MQ queue managers are the main component to define queue and where applications connect to. They can be organized in network to deliver messages between applications and locations. Managers can be organized in cluster to increase high availability and scaling.

We encourage to read the [article from Richard Coppen's: 'IBM MQ fundamentals'](https://developer.ibm.com/components/ibm-mq/articles/mq-fundamentals).

## Major benefits in EDA

* **MQ provides assured delivery of data**: No data loss and no duplication, strong support of exactly once.
* **MQ is horizontally scalable**: As the workload for a single queue manager increases, it is easy to add more queue managers to share tasks and distribute the messages across them. 
* **Highly available**
* Integrate well with Mainframe to propagate transaction to eventual consistenty world of cloud native distributed applications. Writing to database and MQ queue is part of the same transaction, which simplifies the injection into event backbone like Kafka, via MQ connector.
* Containerized to run on modern kubernetes platform.

### Decentralized architecture

The figure below illustrates the different ways to organize the MQ brokers according to the applications' needs.

![](./images/decentralized.png)

* On the top row applications have decoupled queue managers, with independent availability / scalability. The ownership is decentralized, as each application owner also own the broker configuration and deployment. Such cloud native application may adopt the [Command Query Responsability Seggregation](/patterns/cqrs/) pattern and use queues to propagage information between the microservices. The deploy of both broker and microservices follow the same CI/CD pipeline, with a kustomize to describe the broker configuration. See the [CQRS with MQ implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-reefer-mgr-cmd) we did for the Reefer manager service in the vaccine solution.  
* A central MQ broker can still be part of the architecture to support legacy application and federated queues. 

This type of deployment supports heterogenous operational procedures across technologies. 

### Scaling and High availability

A set of topology can be defined to support HA:

![topology](./images/mq-topologies.png)

1. Single resilient queue manager: MQ broker runs in a VM or a single container, and if it stops the VM or pod scheduler will restart it. This is using the platform resynch capability combined with HA storage. IP Address is kept between the instance. The queue content is saved to a storage supporting HA. In the case of container, new restarted pod will connect to existing storage, and the IP gateway routes traffic to the active instance via service and app selector.
1. Multi-instance queue manager: active - standby topology - Failover is triggered on failure of the active instance. IP Address is also kept. When using k8s, the stand-by broker is on a separate node, ready to be activated.
1. replicated data queue manager: this is an extension of the previous pattern where data saved locally is replicated to other sites. Not supported in the k8s.

The deployed MQ broker is defined in k8s as a `StatefulSet` which may not restart automatically in case of node failure. So there is a time to fail over, which is not the case with the full replication mechanism of Kafka.

### Disaster recovery

## Installation with Cloud Pak for Integration

Starting with release 2020.2, MQ can be installed via Kubernetes Operator on Openshift platform. From the operator catalog search for MQ. See the [product documentation installation guide](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.ctr.doc/ctr_installing_ui.htm) for up to date details.

You can verify your installation with the following CLI, and get the IBM catalogs accessible:

```shell
oc project openshift-marketplace
oc get CatalogSource
NAME                   DISPLAY                TYPE      PUBLISHER     AGE
certified-operators    Certified Operators    grpc      Red Hat       42d
community-operators    Community Operators    grpc      Red Hat       42d
ibm-operator-catalog   ibm-operator-catalog   grpc      IBM Content   39d
opencloud-operators    IBMCS Operators        grpc      IBM           39d
redhat-marketplace     Red Hat Marketplace    grpc      Red Hat       42d
redhat-operators       Red Hat Operators      grpc      Red Hat       42d
```

Once everything is set up, create an operator. The IBM MQ operator can be installed scoped to a single namespace or all namespaces.

Verify your environment fits the deployment. [Prepare your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for MQ](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.ctr.doc/ctr_prepare_project_ui.htm)
Then once the operator is installed (it could take up to a minute), go to the operator page and create a MQ Manager instance. For example be sure to have defined an ibm-entitlement-key in the project you are planning to use to deploy MQ manager

 <img src="./images/mq-mgr-via-operator.png" width="200px"></img>

Then update the Yaml file for name, license and persistence.

 <img src="./images/mq-yaml.png" width="200px"></img>

As an alternate, define a QueueManager manifest yaml file as:

 ```yaml
apiVersion: mq.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: QueueManager
metadata:
  name: eda-mq-lab
spec:
  version: 9.2.0.0-r1
  license:
    accept: true
    license: L-RJON-BN7PN3
    use: NonProduction
  web:
    enabled: true
  queueManager:
    name: "EDAQMGR1"
    storage:
      queueManager:
        type: ephemeral
  template:
    pod:
      containers:
       - name: qmgr
         env:
         - name: MQSNOAUT
           value: "yes"
 ```

 Then create the QueueManager resource: 

 ```shell
 oc apply -f mq-manager.yaml 
 # Get the UI route 
 oc describe queuemanager eda-mq-lab
 ```

 You should get the console from this URL: https://eda-mq-lab-ibm-mq-web-....containers.appdomain.cloud/ibmmq/console/#/

To access to the `mqsc` CLI and run configuration remote connect via `oc exec -it <podname> bash`.

## Running MQ in docker

The [following recent article](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/mq-connect-app-queue-manager-containers/) from Richard J. Coppen presents such deployment, and can be summarized as:

```shell
# Use Docker to create a volume:
docker volume create qm1data
# Start queue manager: QM1
docker run --env LICENSE=accept --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1 --volume qm1data:/mnt/mqm --publish 1414:1414 --publish 9443:9443 --detach --env MQ_APP_PASSWORD=passw0rd ibmcom/mq:latest
# The queue managerâ€™s listener listens on port 1414 for incoming connections and port 9443 is used by MQ console
```

One queue is created DEV.QUEUE.1 and a channel: DEV.APP.SRVCONN. 

Then `docker exec` on the docker container and use the `mqsc` CLI.

The [ibm-messaging/mq-container](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-container) github repository describes properties and different configurations.

## Getting access to the MQ manager

The MQ Console is a web browser based interface for interacting with MQ objects. It comes pre-configured inside the developer version of MQ in a container. On localhost deployment the URL is [ https://localhost:9443/ibmmq/console/]( https://localhost:9443/ibmmq/console/) while on OpenShift it depends of the Route created.
